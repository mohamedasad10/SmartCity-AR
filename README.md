## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an **Augmented Reality (AR) based educational tool** that visualizes proposed enhancements for Cape Town's **Foreshore Freeway Precinct**. The tool allows urban planners, architects, students, and the public to interact with a 3D model of the precinct and explore different urban design choices. These choices include improvements to pedestrian access, public transport integration, mixed-use developments, and optimized road networks.

The AR tool will enable users to toggle between different infrastructure layers, compare sustainable and unsustainable planning approaches, and visualize key concepts in urban development in a localized and interactive way.

## Key Features
- **Interactive AR Visualization**: Explore the Foreshore Freeway Precinct in AR with various urban design layers.
- **Pedestrian-Friendly Infrastructure**: Visualize and interact with proposed pedestrian walkways and spaces.
- **Public Transport Integration**: See how improvements to the MyCiTi bus system and other transport hubs will impact mobility and reduce congestion.
- **Mixed-Use Developments**: Explore the potential for mixed-use spaces beneath the freeway to improve land utilization.
- **Toggle Layers**: Toggle between infrastructure layers (roads, public spaces, transport hubs, etc.) to visualize their interactions and potential impacts.
- **Sustainable vs. Unsustainable Approaches**: Compare different planning scenarios to see how design choices affect connectivity, congestion, and urban growth.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity 6**: The primary platform for developing the AR application.
- **AR Foundation**: Unity's framework for building AR applications that support both iOS and Android.
- **C#**: Programming language used for scripting interactions and logic.
- **3D Models**: Optimized models for various urban elements, including roads, buildings, public transport infrastructure,and more.
