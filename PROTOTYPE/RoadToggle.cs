/*
 * RoadToggle.cs
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION:
 * This script toggles the visibility of road GameObjects in your AR scene when a UI button is clicked.
 * It flips the visibility state (on/off) each time the button is pressed.
 *
 * SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 * - Attach this script to the UI Button GameObject that will control the road visibility.
 * - In the Inspector, assign the "roads" GameObject â€” this should be the parent object that contains all road meshes.
 * - Ensure the roads GameObject is active by default (if you want it visible on app start).
 * - Make sure the button component is present and properly linked to this script.
